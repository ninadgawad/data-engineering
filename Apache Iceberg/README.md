## Apache Iceberg

[Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) is **an open table format for huge analytic datasets**, designed to bring the reliability and simplicity of SQL tables to big data. 
It enables engines like Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, Hive, and Impala to safely work with the same tables at the same time. 
Iceberg supports flexible SQL commands to merge new data, update existing rows, and perform targeted deletes. 
It offers features such as transactional consistency between multiple applications, time travel for reproducible queries, and version rollback for quickly correcting problems. 
Iceberg is an open-source, community-driven project that is 100% open source and not dependent on any individual tools or data lake engines. 
It is used in production by large technology companies and is rapidly gaining adoption due to its reliability, performance, and scalability
