## COBOL - Common Business Oriented Language

COBOL, which stands for Common Business Oriented Language, is a high-level programming language primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments
It was one of the first popular languages designed to be operating system-agnostic and is still in use in many financial and business applications
COBOL is imperative, procedural, and object-oriented, and it is known for its advanced file handling capabilities, making it suitable for handling huge volumes of data, such as business transactions
Despite being viewed as outdated, COBOL is still widely used, with more lines of code in active use today than any other programming language
It is known for its simplicity, standardization, and portability across platforms
COBOL was developed in 1959 by the Conference on Data Systems Language (CODASYL) and was based on Grace Hopper's FLOW-MATIC programming language
It is still in demand due to the large amount of existing COBOL code and the need to maintain and modernize legacy systems

### Common applications of COBOL
1. Financial Processing
2. Legacy Systems
3. Government Systems
4. Integration with Modern Systems
