## Snowflake 
[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is a **cloud data platform** that provides a single platform for data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and secure sharing and consumption of real-time/shared data.
It offers features such as separation of storage and compute, on-the-fly scalable compute, data sharing, data cloning, and third-party tools support to handle the demanding needs of growing enterprises. 
Snowflake's architecture automatically allocates the right resources for each workload and usage scenario, and it uses a new multi-cluster, shared data architecture that decouples storage, compute resources, and system services.
Snowflake is popular due to its decoupled storage and compute, ease of use, instant elasticity, lower total cost of ownership, and its ability to support multi-cloud environments.
It is a fully managed service, meaning there is no hardware to manage, and ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and tuning are handled by Snowflake
