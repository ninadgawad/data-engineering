## Data Lake

- **Apache Hudi**: Data storage framework for incrimental updates, it transactions, record-level updates/deletes and change streams to data lakes
- **Apache Iceberg**: It is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. Iceberg adds tables to compute engines including Spark, Trino, PrestoDB, Flink and Hive using a high performance table format that works just like a SQL table.
- **Delta**: It is an open source project that enables building a Lakehouse architecture on top of data lakes. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing on top of existing data lakes, such as S3, ADLS, GCS, and HDFS
