## GraphQL

### What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a specification for how to talk to an API. It's typically used over HTTP where the key idea is to POST a "query" to an HTTP endpoint, instead of hitting different HTTP endpoints for different resources.

GraphQL is designed for developers of web/mobile apps (HTTP clients) to be able to make API calls to fetch exactly the data they need from their backend APIs.

Before going further in understanding GraphQL, it's useful to get a sense of how GraphQL is actually used in an HTTP client.
